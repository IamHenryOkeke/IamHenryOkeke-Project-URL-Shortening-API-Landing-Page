## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned
I learnt about Responsive Design in CSS through the use of media queries and using box shadow to add depth effects to boxes in CSS. I also learnt how to query data using a third party API tool using async and promises in Javascript. This returned a JSON from which also learnt how read a particular data from.
